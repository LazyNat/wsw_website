    <section class="box">
        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
            West Suffolk Wolves Esports was founded in 2022 as part of West Suffolk College's Level 3 Esports qualification program.
            What began as a small group of passionate gamers has grown into a formidable competitive force in UK student esports.
            Our players have trained rigorously under professional coaching, developing their mechanical skills and tactical understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, we achieved our breakthrough by securing 5th place in the Apex Cup out of 20 competing teams—a significant milestone that established
            our reputation as serious contenders. We've since competed in the British Esports Student Championships, proving our dedication to competitive excellence.
            Today, Wolves Esports represents not just West Suffolk College, but a symbol of resilience, skill, and sportsmanship in the UK esports scene.
